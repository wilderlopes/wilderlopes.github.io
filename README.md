## Introduction

I am the co-founder and CTO of [Upstride](https://upstride.io), a startup that is [optimizing the performance of neural networks (NNs) via Geometric (Clifford) Algebras](https://wilder-lopes.medium.com/together-lets-unlock-the-full-potential-of-geometric-algebra-in-deep-learning-9450d250f8a8). As a co-founder and CTO, I am the one in charge of building the technical vision, improving the tech and product roadmap, and lead the tech/product teams. To this date we were able to raise over EUR 3 million, of which EUR 1.6 million comes from venture capital.

Before founding Upstride, I was an applied scientist (machine learning and signal processing) at [UCit](https://UCit.fr), where I was responsible for building their software to designing statistical-learning algorithms for computer vision and high-performance comzputing. In 2016 I earned a Ph.D. in Electronics Engineering (signal processing) from the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil, with a one year-long research period at the Technical University Munich (TU Munich), Germany. From 2016 to 2017, I was a Postdoc at Thales Research and Technology in Paris, France. 

My interests include machine learning, deep learning, signal processing, [Geometric (Clifford) Algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_algebra), adaptive filtering, optimization, computer vision, applied mathematics, integrated-circuits design, and high-performance computing.
