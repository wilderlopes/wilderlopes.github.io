## TLDR;

I am an AI entrepreneur, inventor, and research engineer based in the USA (Tulsa, OK)
since Feb 2023, but with a track record of success in Europe
(France, Germany - from 2013 to 2023) and Brazil (born in 1985).

## Short Bio

I currently serve as Chief Architect for Machine Learning at [Permion.ai](https://permion.ai) (contractor), a US-based company building
neurosymbolic artificial intelligence (AI) products to leverage information buried deep in enterprise data. I am
also the founder of [Ogarantia](https://ogarantia.com), an European deep-tech consultancy company bridging the gap between groundbreaking
mathematical techniques and algorithm design to enable the deployment of robust AI in production.

From 2018 to 2021 I was co-founder and CTO of [Upstride](https://upstride.io), a startup that [optimized the performance of
neural networks (NNs) via the use of Clifford (Geometric) Algebras](https://wilder-lopes.medium.com/together-lets-unlock-the-full-potential-of-geometric-algebra-in-deep-learning-9450d250f8a8). As CTO, I was in charge of building
the technical vision, improving the tech and product roadmap, and lead the tech/product teams. Upstride
raised over EUR 3 million, of which EUR 1.6 million from venture capital. In July 2021, Upstride was
acquired by ContentSquare.

Before founding Upstride, I was an applied scientist (machine learning and signal
processing) at [UCit](https://ucit.fr), where I was responsible for building their statistical-learning algorithms and software
for high-performance computing. In 2016 I earned a Ph.D. in Electronics Engineering (machine-learning and signal processing) from the
University of Sao Paulo, Brazil, with a one year-long research period at the Technical University Munich (TU
Munich), Germany. From 2016 to 2017, I was a Postdoc at Thales Research and Technology in Paris, France,
where he developed AI algorithms to increase the power efficiency of supercomputers.

My interests include AI (connectionist and logic-based), signal processing, [Clifford (Geometric) Algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_algebra),
adaptive filtering, computer vision, applied mathematics, integrated-circuits design, and high-performance
computing.
